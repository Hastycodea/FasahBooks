          Our distinctive bookmarks, introduced from the beginning of our
          journey, remain a beloved symbol of our commitment to quality. Every
          purchase at Fasah Books comes with more than just a book â€“ it comes
          with a piece of Fasah$apos;s legacy. Our trademark bookmarks, which
          are as old as the shop itself, have stood the test of time. When our
          customers buy their books they are sure to leave with something more:
          the prestige bookmark.
